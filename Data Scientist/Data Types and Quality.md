- Data <-- collection of organized observations
- Two types of organizations: methodology and shape

- Methodology <-- how the data was collected
- Shape <-- most common shape is spreadsheet or table


Shape of data:
- In a well-organized dataset, the variables describe a characteristic of our entity -- good variables measure only one characteristic and should not be a characteristic themselves. 

Variable Type:
- Variables that are measured are Numerical variables -- combination or measurement and unit
  Two ways to get a number <-- by counting and measuring
  Counting <-- gives whole number and discrete variables
  Measuring <-- gives us potentially partial values and continuous variables
- Variables that are categorized are Categorical variables -- describe characteristics with words or relative values
  Nominal variable -- named value
  Dichotomous variable -- 2 logical possibilities (yes or no / on or off)
  Ordinal variable -- like ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd place in a competition, etc.)

Messy dataset:
- Typos
- Missing data
- Inconsistent coding

Missing data:
- Missing completely at random <-- data that wasn't entered properly
- Missing at random <-- we can predict is one value is missing based on the value in another variable
- Structurally missing <-- we wouldn't expect a value there to begin with

Accuracy:
- Accuracy <-- how well records reflect reality

Validity:
- Validity <-- relationship between the dataset and its purpose

Representative samples:
- Sampling error <-- any time a sample is made that doesn't reflect the entire population
